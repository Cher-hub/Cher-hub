Ever since I 🤓 started tinkering with those entry-level IT classes, I knew cybersecurity was my calling! Sure, I'm still a newbie - those early programming projects like building a calculator were my first baby steps into tech. But learning about networks and data security gave me such an adrenaline rush 🔥. I love puzzles and tackling tough problems that have real world impacts. And let's be honest, fending off hackers is pretty badass! 😎

With all the rapid changes in technology, it means I'll get to constantly learn new things - which is perfect for my curious mind. 🧠 I may not have formal credentials...yet! But I'm motivated to put in the work to grow into an experienced pro. 💪 My analytical skills and risk-taking attitude make me primed for cybersecurity challenges. I haven't mastered this space quite yet, but something just clicks and I know this field is meant for me! 🎯 Even if I took an unconventional path to get here. 😅 I can't wait to prove myself and secure the tech that runs our world! 🙌
